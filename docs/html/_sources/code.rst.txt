Documentation of modules, classes and functions of the rescomp package.

Most of the functionality of this package is bundled in two main classes: ESN
and ESNWrapper. (ESN stands for for Echo State Network.)
For all normal usage of the rescomp package, :ref:`ESNWrapper<esnwrapper_class>`
is the class to use.
